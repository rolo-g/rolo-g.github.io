  <p>
    This is a DHCP client that follows the RFC 2131 spec. It uses an ENC28J60 Ethernet controller connected to a Ti TM4C evaluation board via SPI. Ethernet, IP, and UDP libraries were provided, with the DHCP implementation building on top of those libraries being written from scratch in C. It follows the typical DHCP state machine as outlined by the RFC 2131 spec. <br><br>
    
    This project on its own does not do much, as it is meant to be used as a basic framework for future "Internet of Things" devices that may require a DHCP implementation. Once the device is in a DHCP bound state, it can send ICMP requests and receive ICMP responses, along with being able to send and reply to ARP requests. <br><br>

    This page is still under construction, however the full project source code is available in the link above on GitHub.
